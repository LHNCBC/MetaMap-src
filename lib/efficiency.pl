/* atom_gc_threshold(?Threshold)

atom_gc_threshold/1 is a factual predicate with one clause indicating the
threshold to be used for atom garbage collection.  It is initially 0 but
is recomputed after each garbage collection.  It is set to
                     <base> + 1/2*<free>
where <base> is the amount of atom space in use and <free> the amount free
after the garbage collection.  */
